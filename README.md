## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# My name is Tala Sleman, and I'm a driven and enthusiastic Computer Science student at Concordia University. Since the beginning of my journey as a software developer, I've been captivated by the limitless possibilities of programming, and I constantly strive to expand my knowledge and tackle challenging projects.
What sets me apart? I bring a unique mix of technical and creative skills to the table, with experience in marketing and UI design. This blend allows me to create projects that are not just technically sound, but also user-centric.
